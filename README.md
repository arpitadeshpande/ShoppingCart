# ShoppingCart
This is code that I wrote with the help of MIT | xPro that is used to show React Shopping cart application using Strapi DB.

SHOPPING CART
This is a project where we create list of items with cost and instock.We add items selected in the cart and check out.By Hitting API we can restock the items back to cart.

Installation
Installing is very easy...

Download Files Keep the files in the respective locations Open the Index.html file in the browser I recommend using chrome.Along with that we need to start strapi DB side by side inorder hit the back end API.
If normal chrome doesn't open then we need to click on window type run ,and in the box type chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security hit enter.New chrome will open load the index.html in that .

Roadmap
May be we can add few more features such as login , creating account ,history of items etc.
